# General-Purpose-Processor
The purpose of this lab was to use components from previous labs to to construct a basic general-purpose processor. Two latches made up the control unit, which passed the input values to other system components after momentarily storing them. The finite state machine or FSM, which determined the controller sequence pattern, was a part of the control unit. The signal from the FSM to the operation-selector microcode was decoded using a 4:16 decoder constructed from two 3:8 decoders that was also included in the control unit. The primary part of the GPU was the ALU, which performed all necessary arithmetic and logical operations for all three parts of the lab. Seven-segment displays were used to display the output. Together, these parts were able to develop a basic GPU in this lab.
